# This is Comtrade testing task for Junior Developer

##1.       Following good development practices, write a program which can be called from the command line and has this functionality:

 

-          Connects to this URL (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to fetch and parse JSon data.

-          Counts users by their email domain (i.e. .net, .org. com, etc.)

-          Prints out top 10 results in format “domain - count”

##2.       Also please share your thoughts on following, (there is no unique right answer):

 

-          Which functional / non-functional flaws can you identify from this specification?

-          Considering the whole system, which failure points can you identify?

-          How would you notify the user if there are issues with execution of the application?

-          How would you measure performance of this application?

-          How would you stress-test this application?
